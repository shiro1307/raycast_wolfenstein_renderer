# JS Raycasting Engine

A 2.5D raycasting engine built from scratch with JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas. Inspired by classic games like [Wolfenstein 3D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D), this project turns a simple 2D grid map into a convincing 3D perspective using rays, trigonometry, and real-time rendering.
